## Summary

Expense Reconciliation is a tool for keeping track of shared expenses and assigned a split value to each expense.

Transactions can be uploaded using the OFX format and are stored in a relational database. Transactions are then listed on the app and can be split according to pre-set values or a custom amount.

Google OAuth is used as the identity provider for logging in.
